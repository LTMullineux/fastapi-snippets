# fastapi-snippets

A selection of snippets to make working with FastAPI a dream ❤️.

The snippets are split into sub-projects, each of which solves a particular problem:

- **00-ultimate-fastapi-project-setup** using FastAPI, SQLModel, Async Postgres, Pytest and Docker to create the project structure for development, testing and deployment.

- **01-sqlalchemy-pydantic-crud-factory-pattern** implementing the factory and repository pattern in a SQLAlchemy and Pydantic application to simplify everything.
